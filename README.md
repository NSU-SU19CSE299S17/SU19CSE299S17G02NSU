**Project Idea:**

**‘Bookworm’** is a content-based book recommending system. It is a web application where the user can get new book recommendations based on the books they have read.

Being an avid book reader means one would always be on the lookout for more books to read. Bookworm is an accessible web application that brings everything in one place. The user can make an organized library to keep track of all the books they read, search for new ones and discover books from our recommendations that suites their individual needs.

**Features:**

- Register – User will create an account by registering with their email address and password and would be able to edit account details.

- Book library – User will have a library of books they have read in their profile. They can add, delete and edit accordingly.

- Search engine – Users can search for books from a vast collection using filters like genre, name, author name etc.

- Recommendation – Users will be recommended new books to read that are similar to the books they have in their library.

**Technology:**

The front-end will be a series of web pages and the back-end will consist of a Database system and a Web Server to host and run our program. The web pages will be made using **Django** web framework, **HTML**, ** CSS** and **JavaScript**.  **Python** will be heavily used in the back-end for the database and also the recommending algorithm.

**Monetization/Business Plan:**

**Bookworm** will allow user to register and create their personal library of books read and discover many more in our vast collection. We will monetise this web application by displaying relevant advertisements on the side panels of the website. In order to get rid of these advertisements and use the recommender and other features the user have to pay a monthly subscription. The payment procedure can be done through Bkash or credit card. Users can also donate a certain amount of money for further development of the site or the **Bookworm** community. These ensures the continuous monetary support for the project.
